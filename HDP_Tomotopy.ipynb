       "3  having been to the florida location numerous times over the years i didn't know how this one would compare. the much smaller footprint made it quicker easier to get from ride to ride. the cinderella's castle was much much smaller, but also being renovated. many of the rides were identical, while some were notably different. the indiana jones ride (which fl does not have) was awesome. space mountain was much more puke worthy. it's a small world was way more beautiful from the exterior. they had several of the old rides that fl doesn't have (like pinocchio and mr. toad). i love how their fast passes worked... it was easy to use and we were able to use them back to back on rides, fast passing almost everything we wanted to ride. we went the first week of april and while crowded, i didn't think it was too bad. we were only in the park for like 7 hours and i do wish i'd had about 3 more hours to do everything.   \n",
